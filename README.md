# [FPSMeter](http://darsa.in/fpsmeter)

Simple JavaScript library for sexy, fast, and themable FPS meter. It can measure:

- frames per second
- number of milliseconds between frames
- number of milliseconds it takes to render one frame

FPSMeter rendering is optimized and chained to requestAnimationFrame (with a polyfill for older browsers), so it should
be as smooth and as fast as possible. It also supports multiple instances on one page, has show/hide methods that also
pause the meter rendering, and color heatmaps that make themes even more pretty!

#### Dependencies

None.

#### Compatibility

Works in IE7+ and all modern browsers.

### [Changelog](https://github.com/Darsain/fpsmeter/wiki/Changelog)

FPSMeter upholds the [Semantic Versioning Specification](http://semver.org/).
